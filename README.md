This tool checks all your contacts and lists every contact ordered by their last public post.

Future features will be:

* Only list contacts with minimum days since last public post
* Delete listed contacts
* Write listed contacts a PM or (if that contact does not share with out) a post (only visible to that contact) containing a mention of that contact.
